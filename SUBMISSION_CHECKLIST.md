## Common Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Why did you choose this strategy?"
**Answer:** 
"I chose a hybrid approach combining mean reversion and momentum because precious metals markets exhibit both characteristics. Mean reversion captures profit from temporary price extremes, while momentum confirmation reduces false signals. The volatility filter helps avoid choppy markets where both approaches struggle."

### Q2: "How does your strategy handle different market conditions?"
**Answer:**
"The strategy adapts through several mechanisms:
1. ATR-based stops adjust to volatility (wider in volatile markets)
2. Volatility filter avoids low-volatility periods
3. Trend alignment prevents counter-trend trades
4. Dynamic position sizing reduces size when uncertainty is high"

### Q3: "What makes your strategy robust to unseen data?"
**Answer:**
"Several design choices enhance robustness:
1. Normalized indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands) work at any price level
2. No hard-coded price thresholds
3. Simple parameter set reduces overfitting risk
4. Same strategy works on both Gold and Silver
5. Conservative risk management (2% per trade) limits damage from failures"

### Q4: "What are the main risks of your strategy?"
**Answer:**
"The main risks are:
1. Black swan events (sudden crashes) may trigger stop-losses
2. Extended sideways markets reduce profitability
3. Gap openings can bypass stop-losses
4. Indicator lag may delay entries/exits
5. Transaction costs erode profits in low-volatility periods"

### Q5: "How would you improve this strategy?"
**Answer:**
"Potential improvements:
1. Multi-timeframe analysis (M1, M5, H1 confirmation)
2. Machine learning for signal weighting
3. Sentiment analysis from news/social media
4. Correlation trading (Gold-Silver spread)
5. Adaptive parameters based on market regime detection"

## Final Pre-Submission Tests

### Test 1: Basic Functionality
```powershell
python test_setup.py
# Expected: All checks pass ✓
```

### Test 2: Gold Backtest
```powershell
python strategy.py data\XAUUSD_M1\DAT_MT_XAUUSD_M1_2024.csv
# Expected: Sharpe > 1.0, trades executed, plot opens
```

### Test 3: Silver Backtest
```powershell
python strategy.py data\XAGUSD_M1\DAT_MT_XAGUSD_M1_2024.csv
# Expected: Similar performance to Gold
```

### Test 4: Quick Comparison
```powershell
python quick_test.py compare
# Expected: Both assets tested, comparison table shown
```

### Test 5: Parameter Optimization (Optional)
```powershell
python optimize_params.py data\XAUUSD_M1\DAT_MT_XAUUSD_M1_2024.csv 20
# Expected: Optimal parameters found, overfitting < 30%
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: TA-Lib won't install
**Solution 1:** Use conda
```powershell
conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
```

**Solution 2:** Download pre-built wheel
- Visit: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib
- Download appropriate wheel for your Python version
- Install: `pip install TA_Lib-0.4.XX-cpXX-cpXX-win_amd64.whl`

### Problem: No trades executed
**Solutions:**
1. Check data loaded correctly (should show ~350k bars)
2. Verify indicators are calculating (run with debug output)
3. Relax RSI thresholds: Change `rsi_os = 30` to `35`, `rsi_ob = 70` to `65`
4. Reduce volatility filter threshold

### Problem: Too many trades (>100/day)
**Solutions:**
1. Verify daily counter is working (check code)
2. Increase RSI thresholds for stricter entry
3. Add additional confirmation requirements

### Problem: Poor Sharpe Ratio (<1.0)
**Solutions:**
1. Run parameter optimization: `python optimize_params.py ...`
2. Check commission is set correctly (0.00002)
3. Verify stop-loss and take-profit logic
4. Consider testing on different data subset
